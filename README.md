## Description
Your Challenge this week is emblematic of the fact that most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as the ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. And as user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant.

This week, you’ll take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.
  
## Deployment  
To run this app on your local machine, you will want to clone this repository. You will need to make sure that you have Node.js installed, as well as MongoDB. Once you have cloned the repo, use the terminal to navigate to the project's root directory and type the following: `npm install`. Followed by, `npm start`.
